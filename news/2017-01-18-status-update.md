Hi there,

First of all it seems like the false positive with Windows Defender was
resolved after the dispute to the Malware Protection Center.

There is a bug fix/minor enhancement update (v1.1.0) coming. I don't have a clear
ETA but I hope to have it ready in the next couple of weeks.

This update resolves some known issues like the "No results" when
when accessing compilation Artists. I am not sure if I will start
a staged rollout on production channel or if I will deploy it for
a while on the beta channel in order to gather feedback.

There are also a couple of issues on the plugin side, regard the
favorite button not updating and the rating not working properly on a
non English locale.

You can see the progress of the v1.1.0 on [GitHub](https://github.com/kelsos/mbrc/milestone/9).

After this I will work on v1.2.0 [GitHub](https://github.com/kelsos/mbrc/milestone/3)
the features are almost closed for that update. After getting teh
v1.2.0 update released, there will be only bug fixes for v1.x and the
development for v2.0.0 will start.
