New test version 0.9.6 coming soon with layout fixes, pending stable release on Google Play to replace v0.2.3.1.
Development will slow until September due to personal commitments, with future plans including playlist management and
widget features.

---

I am currently working on some layout fixes, I hope to get another test version out in the next days. This will be
v0.9.6 of the remote application. After this there will be a test period of a few days. If no deal breaking issues -
bugs are reported the version will be promoted to stable and will be deployed to Google Play to replace the existing
v0.2.3.1 of the remote.

After the release of the new version the development will slow down due to a busy schedule (work, exams and I also have
to finish preparing and present my thesis) till the end of September.

The features that are planned for the next release after this one, are the implementation of Playlist Management. And
the addition of widgets.
