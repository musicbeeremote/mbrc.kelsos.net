Website transitions from Jekyll to VitePress for improved performance.

## Website Modernization

As part of the broader modernization efforts, I'm transitioning the documentation and website from Jekyll to VitePress.
This upgrade brings several benefits:

- Faster page loading and better performance
- Enhanced documentation features
- Better Vue.js integration
- Modern tooling and Markdown support

The new website will maintain all existing content while providing a more streamlined and responsive experience for the users.

## Development resumes

I’m excited to announce that during Christmas I decided to resume development of the MusicBee Remote application.

### What's coming

The initial roadmap for the application is to proceed with the following improvements:

- Add support for Android 15
- Drop outdated and legacy dependencies
- Make the codebase easier to maintain
- Enhance overall stability and performance

### Play Store Return

For the last few years I removed the application from Google Play Store because of the lack of
energy and time to maintain it. The primary goal after this update is done is to restore the application
to Google Play Store to make it easily accessible once again.

### Next Steps

I’m going to make sure that the application is stable and ready in the coming months.
Stay tuned for progress updates and beta testing opportunities.

For those interested in following the development progress or contributing to the project,
