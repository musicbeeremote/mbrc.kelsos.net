Development delayed due to mandatory 9-month army service starting March 11th.
Limited computer and internet access expected during this period,
affecting update timeline and communication responsiveness.

Some status update.

I was hoping to get the new version out by mid march, unfortunately this is not possible anymore. There is more work to
be completed in order to push the update and starting the 11th of March I will be doing my mandatory army service for a
period of 9 months, this means I can't know for sure when the next update will be out.

The most probable scenario is that I will not have computer access for the greatest part of the next 9 months. I will
try to work to complete the features when I get back home, but I can't guarantee anything.

Also it will probably take a while to reply to e-mails/posts since I won't have any Internet access.
